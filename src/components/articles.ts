    name: "Why Is Customer Experience Important For Your Business in 2023?",
    article: `The most successful businesses today are built on great customer experience. And, if you’re not there yet, you should make this your top priority.
But why should any business be concerned about customer experience? Because it’s good for business and it helps drive sales as well as improve customer retention. Customers expect your businesses to deliver an outstanding experience every time they engage with you.

Let’s explore why you should care about delivering an excellent customer experience and how you can do it.

What is Customer Experience (CX)?
Customer experience (CX) is the way your customers feel about their interactions with your brand. It’s about what they think and how they feel.
Your customers’ experiences encompass all their interactions with you, from the time they find your business to after they’ve made a purchase.

CX is one of the most important things you can measure for your business. It impacts revenue generation and tells you about your customers’ brand loyalty. A satisfied customer is more likely to do business with you again and recommend you to others. Unhappy customers are less likely to buy from you again and might even deter others from doing so as well.

What’s the difference between customer experience and customer service?
There is often confusion about the difference between ‘Customer Service’ and ‘Customer Experience’. Customer service is one element of CX that focuses on human interactions & directly supporting customers; while Customer experience is the sum of all interactions a customer has with your company.

Importance of Customer Experience for your business
The importance of customer experience cannot be overstated. A satisfied customer develops trust in your brand and is more likely to continue doing business with you.
Some benefits you can reap from an exceptional experience to your customers include:

Increase in customer retention & brand loyalty – A great customer experience will make your customers stick around for the long haul.
A recent study by PwC found that 73% of consumers say a good experience is key in influencing their brand loyalties.
Increase in revenue – Happy customers are more likely to continue doing business with you and also recommend you to others. This translates into increased customer lifetime value (LTV) and ongoing revenue growth opportunities.
Competitive advantage – Customers expect a positive experience and when they perceive an interaction as a bad experience, they can leave. Investing in your customers’ experience will give you a competitive advantage against your competitors who don’t.`,

    name: "Benefits of Using CRM in the Contact Center",
    article: `When it comes to customer engagement, the contact center is where most businesses and their customers meet. The contact center’s primary goals are increasing retention and improving overall satisfaction. With such important roles in business, contact centers need as much help as they can get to improve their results.

Read on to find out how contact centers can use CRM to improve the way they serve their customers.

What is a CRM
A CRM, or customer relationship management system, is a software application that helps businesses to store & manage customer data. CRMs help salespeople and support staff keep track of who their customers are, their interactions with the business; including when they have contacted the company, what they purchased, how long they have been customers, whether they are satisfied and what they’d like to see in the future.

CRM systems allow you to collect, store and track information on every customer interaction. CRMs are also designed to help you automate routine tasks, so you can focus on better serving your customers.

Why use CRM in the contact center
Integrating your contact center software with a CRM is a great way to improve your customers’ experience. It gives your team access to past interactions and purchases history without having to switch across multiple platforms.

With all the information accessible on one interface, your agents are better equipped to solve customers’ challenges, make recommendations and personalize their approach.

Benefits of CRM in the contact center
In today’s world of customer-centric service and increased competition, you need to build strong relationships with your customers and streamline processes to provide excellent experiences. You can achieve this by integrating CRM applications into your operations and most importantly into your contact center.

Here are a few ways your business can benefit from integrating a CRM into your contact center:

1) Reduction in Resolution time
When a customer gets in touch with your business, it is vital for the agent to answer their queries quickly and efficiently. Your customers do not want to wait in a long queue to be connected with an agent who can resolve their issue or be requested to wait for a callback.

A CRM integration equips agents with the necessary customer context and purchase information. This paves way for meaningful interactions and quick query resolution.

2) Improved Agent Productivity
Agent’s most important role is to provide great customer service. Unfortunately, most agents’ time is taken by call prep, long call durations & post-call activities.

CRM makes it easier for agents to do their job by providing them with the information they need about the customer they’re speaking with, quickly and efficiently. An integrated CRM gives agents real-time access to the customer information they need without having to search through spreadsheets or other documents. This helps your agents to be more efficient and also reduces the time it takes to resolve issues.

Integrated CRM in the contact center also helps agents to handle routine tasks such as scheduling follow-up calls and updating records in real-time. This automation minimizes the manual intervention required, thereby reducing errors and improving productivity.

3) Increased Sale opportunity
Integrated CRM enables contact center agents to accurately collect data across all interactions with a customer. This data can be useful to identify and predict similar or alternate solutions that a customer could benefit from.
The information can also be used to personalize outbound interactions that can be more effective and drive better conversions.

4) Improved Customer Experiences
Your customer is the main driver for growth in your business, therefore their satisfaction is key in every interaction.
CRM integration gives you valuable information about your customers, their needs, and their preferences. Because of this integration, customers don’t have to repeatedly provide their information or explain any previous interactions with you. This information can also be used to personalize interactions and connect them with the best resources for prompt resolution.
Ultimately, you’re able to simplify the customer journey and increase their satisfaction.

In Conclusion
The benefits of integrating a CRM solution into your contact center are clear to see. It enables your agents to improve their interactions and provide the best customer experience.
